The use of the “Dies Irae” plainchant has a long history in film music and other assorted media.[^1] Its liturgical text comprises vivid imagery of burning ash, illustrating the final day of judgement, and its modal music fits comfortably within a tonal context, highlighting the lowered third and seventh scale degrees. It is no surprise then that quoting the “Dies Irae” chant remains a popular option for composers of film music; in fact, using the “Dies Irae” in your film score today usually ellicits the same response of recognition in listeners as does the stock sound effect (the “Wilhelm Scream”).

Prominent examples of this chant appear in nearly every decade of the history of film music, ranging from _It’s a Wonderful Life_ (1946) to _10 Cloverfield Lane_ (2016). For more, see my supercut of 30+ films, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLGa6vfDTIM&t=28s">"_Hidden in Plain Sight: Film Music's "Dies Irae"_"</a>, and the film on which I consulted and appeared as a talking head, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3-bVRYRnSM&t=128s">"_Why This Creepy Melody Is In So Many Movies_"</a>.

These examples include what I think of as three different types, or classes, of the Dies Irae melody. The first type (Type 1) sees full statements of the melodic phrase: see for example Dmitri Tiomkin’s _It’s a Wonderful Life_, and Wendy Carlos’s _The Shining_. The second type (Type 2) uses a motivic “stinger” of the first four pitches, often punctuating an omninous moment in a scene: see _Iron Man 3_ or John William’s score for _Home Alone_. The third and most prolific of the types (Type 3) embeds the opening of the chant in a rumbling ostinato, as we see in the “Weathertop” sequence from the original _Lord of the Rings_ film or the “panic” theme from _Jurassic Park_.
